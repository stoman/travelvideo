  <h1>Welcome to our Travel Map</h1>

  <p>We are Anna and Stefan. At this website we keep a log of some of the places we visited together. In most of those places we created a short video holding a sign with the name of the city. The videos are concatenated in a way such that each video starts with the same people visible as the last one ended with.</p>

  <p>Explore the {{#link-to 'trip'}}list of our trips{{/link-to}} we did, check the {{#link-to 'map'}}map of locations we visited{{/link-to}}, or just watch some {{#link-to 'random'}}videos in random order{{/link-to}}. To get in touch connect with us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stefan.toman" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. We are looking forward to your messages.</p>

  <p>If you are interested in the technical details of this website built with <a href="https://www.emberjs.com" target="_blank">Ember.js</a> check our <a href="https://github.com/stoman/travelvideo" target="_blank">public GitHub repository</a>. Stars, comments, or even contributions to the code are always welcome.</p>

  <p>See you on the road!</p>
